# Pordle

WELCOME TO THE PORDLE GAME

This repository is made to upload a version of Wordle made in python and played on the terminal. The goal was to try and replicate the game with as many words as possible.

Game State: This game is for a python class final project, but changes are planned to be made for the future of this project outside of the project need.
Goals: The main goal of the game is to implement some sort of UI using Tkinter, as the ability to use and open up a window or even an .exe file would greatly improve the functionality and enjoyability of the game.
